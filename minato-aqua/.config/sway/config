# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs

### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'

    bindsym $mod+Shift+e exec swaynag -t warning -m 'You pressed the exit shortcut. Do you really want to exit sway? This will end your Wayland session.' -B 'Yes, exit sway' 'swaymsg exit'


#
# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
    #bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
    #bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show

#
# Status Bar:
#
exec waybar
# Read `man 5 sway-bar` for more information about this section.
#bar {
#    position top
#
#    # When the status_command prints a new line to stdout, swaybar updates.
#    # The default just shows the current date and time.
#    status_command while date +'%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S %p'; do sleep 1; done
#
#    colors {
#        statusline #ffffff
#        background #323232
